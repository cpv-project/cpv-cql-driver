# Contribution

You should follow these rules when you are contributing code.

- Use tabs instead of spaces
- For class names, use camel case and start with a upper case (e.g. SomeClass)
- For function names, use camel case and start with a lower case (e.g. someFunction)
- For local variable names, use camel case and start with a lower case (e.g. someInt)
- For global variable names, use camel case and start with a upper case (e.g. SomeGlobalValue)
- For class member names, use camel case and start with a lower case and ends with `_` (e.g. someMember_)
- Write comments for every public class and function, keep the code as simple as possible
